# Idea
 I want an application that allows us me to click on a button that will display a list of breweries available and the state it is located in. I want to be able to add a function that allows users to add a new brewery and its location to the list.

# Features
* Change color of buttons when mouse hoves over.
* Show Breweries Button
* Add new breweries to the list (Submit - form)

# MVP - Minimum Viable Product 
* Breweries - API (DOMContentLoaded)
* Button that lists all breweries by name('click')
* Hover over Breweries to show brewery info ('mouseover')
* Add New Brewery ('Submit')

# Events
3 question rule:

- Overall: Be able to click on the button and list the breweries to the page.

- When: On page load (aka: DOMContentLoaded)

- Cause: Click Event

- Effect: Change the header to brewery list and list out the breweries as (li)'s
