# Idea
 I want an application that allows us me to select a state that lists all the breweries available in that state. I want to be able to add a function that likes the brewery and with each like will bring it to a section that shows all your favorite breweries.

# Features
* Brewery API: https://api.openbrewerydb.org/breweries
* Lists all breweries by state (DOMContentLoaded)
* Add to favorites (Click - button)
* Add notes on breweries (Submit - form)

# MVP 
* Brewery API (fetch)
* Lists all brewerieds (DOMContentLoaded)
* Add a filter to choose by state (filter)
* Add to favorites (Click - button (img of beer clink))
* Add notes on breweries (Submit event, form tag with button)



# Extra
* Create a randomizer that chooses a brewery for you to try
* CSS to add a navigation bar to our favorites list
