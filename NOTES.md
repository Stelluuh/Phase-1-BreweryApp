# Idea
 I want an application that allows us me to select a state that lists all the breweries available in that state. I want to be able to add a function that likes the brewery and with each like will bring it to a section that shows all your favorite breweries.

# Features
* Brewery API: https://api.openbrewerydb.org/breweries (fetch)
* Search by typing Brewery Name or Search by State (DOMContentLoaded, Submit Form)
* Hover over buttons to show contact information (mouseover)
* Add to favorites (Click - button)
* Add notes on breweries (Submit - form)

# MVP - Minimum Viable Product 
* Button that lists all breweries by name(DOMContentLoaded, 'click')
* Add a filter to choose by state (.filter instead of .find, 'submit')
* Hover over Breweries to show brewery info ('mouseover')




# Extra
* Create a randomizer that chooses a brewery for you to try

# Events
3 question rule:

- Overall: Be able to click on the button and list the breweries to the page.

- When: On page load (aka: DOMContentLoaded)

- Cause: Click Event

- Effect: Change the header to brewery list and list out the meals inside of an unordered list as (li)'s
